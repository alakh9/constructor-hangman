# constructor-hangman
This is a constructor hangman game based on ice cream flavors.
The idea was to make it work directly on node.js.
It has 4 files which link into one another along with a gitignore and packages.
The file main.js is where most of the functionality is for the game itself.
I did have a prolem with making the count go up on how many flavors the user guesess right but other then that most of the game is working properly!
